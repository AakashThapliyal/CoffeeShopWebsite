# CoffeeShopWebsite
Hey there! My name is Aakash Thapliyal and this repository contains the source code for a simple coffee shop webpage showcasing a menu of coffee flavors and desserts. The design is responsive and styled to provide a warm and welcoming feel, perfect for a coffee shop.
This Repo contains two files:
- **indexforcoffieshop.html**: The main HTML file that structures the coffee shop menu and displays essential information like coffee flavors, dessert options, and pricing.
- **coffeeshop.css**: The CSS file used for styling the web page. It applies a cohesive color palette, typography, and layout adjustments for a polished appearance.
